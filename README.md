### About

This is the web app template for accessing miscallenous hardware (joysticks, MIDI, smartcard readers) via the web browser. The communication between the server and the client are handled via websockets.

### Installation

It's required you have NodeJS installed. 

When this is done, install dependencies by running the following in the command line:

	npm install

Then you can run the server:

	node server.js

The server will let you know how to access the web client.

To run the server in non-default port, run:

	node server.js portnumber
